            <h6>Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs
                that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer,
                while hardware is the invariable part. 
                The two main categories of software are application software and system software.
            This example demonstrates different text-align values.
Have fun!
For longer texts, notice that text-align: justify aligns each line so that they look excactly the same width:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet,
nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio, vitae scelerisque enim ligula 
venenatis dolor. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus imperdiet, 
nulla et dictum interdum, nisi lorem egestas odio,
vitae scelerisque enim ligula venenatis dolor.Before you can begin to determine what the composition 
of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement
for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information
in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader
that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph.
A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process
is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct,
familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.

The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed of ideas; 
this “germination process” is better known as brainstorming. There are many techniques for brainstorming;

whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. Building paragraphs
can be like building a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are
building. Any cracks, inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper 
to crumble.

So, let’s suppose that you have done some brainstorming to develop your thesis. What else should you keep
in mind as you begin to.</h6>
            <h4>From the list above, let’s choose “illustration” as our rhetorical 
                purpose. We’ll walk through a 5-step process for building a paragraph
                that illustrates a point in an argument. For each step there is an explanation and 
                example. Our example paragraph will be about human misconceptions of piranhas.</h4>
